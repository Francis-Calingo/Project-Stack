# Project Stack
<p>Here is a sample list of projects categorized by topic. Some projects appear more than once since they cover more than one topic (for example, the project "Using YouTube API to Visualize and Analyze OMNI Filipino's News Coverage in 2024" incorporated elements of data visualization and natural language processing, and is therefore listed under both topics). Some of these projects are not hosted in my GitHub profile, but are instead hosted in external websites such as Tableau Public.</p>

## Data Visualization and Analysis
These projects incorporate processes that take data, then uses techniques that represents them as graphs or maps (data visualization), and clean and evaluate them to draw upon conclusions (data analysis).

## Mapping and Geospatial Analysis
These projects incorporate spatial data (i.e., data that is associated with geographical metrics such as latitude, longitude, geographic divisions such as provinces, coordinates, etc.) and generates maps (either as satellite maps or symbolically).

## Machine Learning
Elements of machine learning, where algorithms were developed to train computers to execute processes that mimick human behaviour given a subset of data, and make predictions, were incorporated in these projects.

## Time-Series Analysis
These projects analyze a sequence of data taken over an interval of time and draw conclusions (e.g., daily COVID-19 cases and deaths, value of a stock over time).

## Webscraping
While manually getting data from a website technically qualifies as webscarping, these projects employ functions that allows the computer to scrape data for the user.
